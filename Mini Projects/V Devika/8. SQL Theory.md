# Introduction to SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a database computer language designed for managing data in relational database management systems (RDBMS).

## What can SQL do?

- SQL can execute queries against a database
- SQL can retrieve data from a database
- SQL can insert records in a database
- SQL can update records in a database
- SQL can delete records from a database
- SQL can create new databases
- SQL can create new tables in a database
- SQL can create stored procedures in a database
- SQL can create views in a database
- SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

## Database Systems

There are various database systems or DBMS (Database Management Systems), such as:

- Microsoft SQL Server
- Oracle
- MySQL
- Microsoft Access
- IBM DB2
- Sybase
- and many others

## Types of SQL Commands

### 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL commands are responsible for defining and managing the structure of databases and their objects.

#### Key DDL Commands:

- **CREATE TABLE**:
   This command is used to create a new table in the database.
  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
        column1 datatype [constraints],
        column2 datatype [constraints],
        ...
        [table_constraints]
    );
    ```

- **ALTER TABLE**:
 ALTER TABLE is used to modify an existing table. It allows you to add, modify, or drop columns, constraints, and indexes.
 
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD column_name datatype [constraints];

    ALTER TABLE table_name
    DROP COLUMN column_name;

    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ALTER COLUMN column_name datatype;

    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name CONSTRAINT_TYPE (column1, column2, ...);
    ```

- **DROP TABLE**:
  DROP TABLE is used to remove an existing table and all its data permanently from the database.
 
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE table_name;
    ```

- **CREATE INDEX**:
  CREATE INDEX creates an index on a table, which helps to speed up SELECT queries that retrieve rows based on specified columns.
  
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX index_name
    ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
    ```

- **DROP INDEX**:
 DROP INDEX removes an existing index from the database.
  
    ```sql
    DROP INDEX index_name;
    ```

- **CREATE CONSTRAINT**:
   Constraints are rules enforced on data columns to maintain data integrity. They can be defined at the time of table creation. 
 Constraints are usually added during table creation using the CREATE TABLE statement.

- **DROP CONSTRAINT**:
  DROP CONSTRAINT is used to remove constraints from an existing table. Constraints can be dropped using the ALTER TABLE statement.

- **TRUNCATE TABLE**:
  TRUNCATE TABLE is used to remove all rows from a table quickly and efficiently.
  
    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
    ```



### 2. Data Query/Retrieval Language (DQL or DRL)

DQL focuses on retrieving data from databases using the `SELECT` statement.

### 3. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML encompasses commands that manipulate data within a database, including `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

- **INSERT**:
 INSERT is used to add new rows of data into a table.
 
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
    VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
    ```

- **UPDATE**:
   UPDATE is used to modify existing data in a table.

    ```sql
    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
    WHERE condition;
    ```

- **DELETE**:
   DELETE is used to remove rows from a table based on a specified condition.

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```



### 4. Data Control Language (DCL)

DCL focuses on managing access rights, permissions, and security-related aspects of a database system using commands like `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.

- **GRANT**:
  GRANT is used to provide specific privileges or access rights to users or roles.
:
    ```sql
    GRANT privilege_name
    ON object_name
    TO {user_name | PUBLIC | role_name}
    [WITH GRANT OPTION];
    ```

- **REVOKE**:
   REVOKE is used to remove previously granted privileges from users or roles.

    ```sql
    REVOKE privilege_name
    ON object_name
    FROM {user_name | PUBLIC | role_name};
    ```


### 5. Transaction Control Language (TCL)

TCL deals with the management of transactions within a database using commands like `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.

- **COMMIT**:
  COMMIT is used to permanently save the changes made in the current transaction to the database.

    ```sql
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **ROLLBACK**:
  ROLLBACK is used to undo changes made in the current transaction and restore the database to its previous state.
 
    ```sql
    ROLLBACK;
    ```

- **SAVEPOINT**:
  SAVEPOINT is used to set a point in the current transaction from which you can later roll back changes.
  
    ```sql
    SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
    ```


# Basic Syntax of SQL Queries

- **SELECT:**
  - The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
  - Syntax: `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;`
  - Use `SELECT *` to select all fields.
  - Example: `SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;`

- **WHERE:**
  - The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
  - Syntax: `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
  - Operators used: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `<>` (Not equal).
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Mexico';`

- **AND, OR, and NOT:**
  - WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT.
  - Syntax:
    - `SELECT ... WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;`
    - `SELECT ... WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;`
    - `SELECT ... WHERE NOT condition;`
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='India' AND City='Japan';`

- **DISTINCT:**
  - Removes duplicate rows from query results.
  - Syntax: `SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2 FROM table_name;`

- **LIKE:**
  - Used to search for a specified pattern in a column.
  - Wildcards: `%` (zero, one, or multiple characters), `_` (single character).
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';`

- **IN:**
  - Filters results based on a list of values in the WHERE clause.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category_id IN (1, 2, 3);`

- **BETWEEN:**
  - Filters results within a specified range.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-06-30';`

- **IS NULL:**
  - Checks for NULL values.
  - Example: `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE email IS NULL;`

- **AS:**
  - Renames columns or expressions in query results.
  - Example: `SELECT first_name AS "First Name", last_name AS "Last Name" FROM employees;`

- **ORDER BY:**
  - Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.
  - Syntax: `SELECT ... ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC];`

- **GROUP BY:**
  - Groups rows based on one or more columns.
  - Syntax: `SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;`

## AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

- **COUNT():** Counts the number of rows in a group or result set.
- **SUM():** Calculates the sum of numeric values.
- **AVG():** Computes the average of numeric values.
- **MAX():** Finds the maximum value.
- **MIN():** Retrieves the minimum value.

  # Types of Constraints in SQL

1. **DEFAULT Constraint**: 
   - It provides a default value for the given column when none is specified.

2. **NOT NULL Constraint**: 
   - Ensures that a given column cannot have a NULL value.

3. **PRIMARY Key**: 
   - Identifies every row/record uniquely in the given database table.

4. **UNIQUE Constraint**: 
   - Ensures that all values in a table's column are different.

5. **INDEX**: 
   - Used to create and retrieve data from the given database quickly.

6. **CHECK Constraint**: 
   - Ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.

7. **FOREIGN Key**: 
   - Identifies a row/record uniquely in any of the given database tables.

# Types of Joins in SQL

In a DBMS, a join is an operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Joins are used to retrieve data from multiple tables by linking them together using a common key or column.

## Types of Joins:

1. **Inner Join:**
   - An inner join combines data from two or more tables based on a specified condition, known as the join condition.
   - The result of an inner join includes only the rows where the join condition is met in all participating tables.
   - It essentially filters out non-matching rows and returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
   - **Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT columns
     FROM table1
     INNER JOIN table2
     ON table1.column = table2.column;
     ```
   - Example:
     ```sql
     -- Inner Join Query
     SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.Product
     FROM Customers
     INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

     ### Customers Table:
     | CustomerID | CustomerName | 
     |------------|--------------| 
     | 1          | Alice        | 
     | 2          | Bob          | 
     | 3          | Carol        | 

     ### Orders Table:
     | OrderID | CustomerID | Product    | 
     |---------|------------|------------| 
     | 101     | 1          | Laptop     | 
     | 102     | 3          | Smartphone | 
     | 103     | 2          | Headphones | 
     ```

2. **Outer Join:**
   - Outer joins combine data from two or more tables based on a specified condition, just like inner joins. However, unlike inner joins, outer joins also include rows that do not have matching values in both tables.
   - **Types:**
     - Left Outer Join (Left Join)
  
       ### Customers Table:
       | CustomerID | CustomerName | 
       |------------|--------------| 
       | 1          | Alice        | 
       | 2          | Bob          | 
       | 3          | Carol        | 

       ### Orders Table:
       | OrderID | CustomerID | Product    | 
       |---------|------------|------------| 
       | 101     | 1          | Laptop     | 
       | 102     | 3          | Smartphone | 
       | 103     | 2          | Headphones | 
       | NULL    | 4          | Monitor    | 

     - Right Outer Join (Right Join)

       ### Customers Table:
       | CustomerID | CustomerName | 
       |------------|--------------| 
       | 1          | Alice        | 
       | 2          | Bob          | 
       | 3          | Carol        | 
       | 4          | NULL         | 

       ### Orders Table:
       | OrderID | CustomerID | Product    | 
       |---------|------------|------------| 
       | 101     | 1          | Laptop     | 
       | 102     | 3          | Smartphone | 
       | 103     | 2          | Headphones | 

     - Full Outer Join (Full Join)

       ### Customers Table:
       | CustomerID | CustomerName | 
       |------------|--------------| 
       | 1          | Alice        | 
       | 2          | Bob          | 
       | 3          | Carol        | 
       | 4          | NULL         | 

       ### Orders Table:
       | OrderID | CustomerID | Product    | 
       |---------|------------|------------| 
       | 101     | 1          | Laptop     | 
       | 102     | 3          | Smartphone | 
       | 103     | 2          | Headphones | 
       | NULL    | 4          | Monitor    | 

3. **Cross Join:**
   - A cross join, also known as a Cartesian product, is a type of join operation in a Database Management System (DBMS) that combines every row from one table with every row from another table.
   - Unlike other join types, a cross join does not require a specific condition to match rows between the tables. Instead, it generates a result set that contains all possible combinations of rows from both tables.
   - **Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT columns
     FROM table1
     CROSS JOIN table2;
     ```
   - Example:
     ```sql
     -- Cross Join Query
     SELECT Students.StudentName, Courses.CourseName
     FROM Students
     CROSS JOIN Courses;

     ### Students Table:
     | StudentID | StudentName | 
     |-----------|-------------| 
     | 1         | Alice       | 
     | 2         | Bob         | 

     ### Courses Table:
     | CourseID | CourseName | 
     |----------|------------| 
     | 101      | Maths      | 
     | 102      | Science    | 
     ```

4. **Self Join:**
   - A self join involves joining a table with itself.
   - This technique is useful when a table contains hierarchical or related data and you need to compare or analyse rows within the same table.
   - Self joins are commonly used to find relationships, hierarchies, or patterns within a single table.
   - **Syntax:**
     ```sql
     SELECT columns
     FROM table1 AS alias1
     JOIN table1 AS alias2 ON alias1.column = alias2.column;
     ```
   - Example:
     ```sql
     -- Self Join Query
     SELECT e1.EmployeeName AS Employee, e2.EmployeeName AS Manager
     FROM Employees AS e1
     JOIN Employees AS e2 ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID;

     ### Employees Table:
     | EmployeeID | EmployeeName | ManagerID | 
     |------------|--------------|-----------| 
     | 1          | Alice        | 3         | 
     | 2          | Bob          | 3         | 
     | 3          | Carol        | NULL      | 
     | 4          | David        | 1         | 
     ```

#  SQL Window Functions

SQL window functions provide a powerful way to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without the need for complex self-joins or subqueries. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and functionalities of SQL window functions:

1. **Partitioning Data:**
   - Window functions operate on a subset of rows defined by a partition.
   - Partitions group rows with the same values in specified columns, forming distinct subsets for calculations.

2. **Ordering Data:**
   - Within each partition, rows are ordered based on specified criteria.
   - The order determines the sequence in which window functions process rows within each partition.

3. **Syntax:**
   - Window functions are invoked using an OVER clause, which defines the window of rows over which the function operates.
   - The OVER clause specifies the partitioning and ordering of rows for the window function.

4. **Common Window Functions:**
   - **ROW_NUMBER():** Assigns a unique integer to each row within a partition, based on the specified order.
   - **RANK() and DENSE_RANK():** Assign ranks to rows within a partition, with RANK() leaving gaps for ties and DENSE_RANK() producing consecutive ranks.
   - **SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX():** Compute aggregate values over a window of rows.
   - **LEAD() and LAG():** Access data from subsequent or preceding rows within the partition, respectively.
   - **NTILE():** Distributes rows into a specified number of buckets, assigning a bucket number to each row.
   - **FIRST_VALUE() and LAST_VALUE():** Retrieve the first or last value in the specified order within the partition.
   - **PERCENT_RANK() and CUME_DIST():** Calculate the relative rank of a row within a partition.

5. **Benefits of Window Functions:**
   - **Simplicity:** Window functions simplify complex analytical queries, eliminating the need for self-joins or subqueries.
   - **Performance:** They often provide better performance compared to alternative methods due to optimized query execution.
   - **Readability:** Window functions enhance query readability and maintainability by encapsulating analytical logic within the query itself.

6. **Use Cases:**
   - **Ranking and Top-N Queries:** Determine top performers, highest sales, or most recent records within each category.
   - **Moving Averages and Cumulative Totals:** Compute rolling averages, running totals, or cumulative sums over time or ordered sequences.
   - **Comparative Analysis:** Compare current values with previous or subsequent values to identify trends or deviations.
   - **Data Imputation and Interpolation:** Fill missing values based on neighboring values within the dataset.

7. **Compatibility:**
   - Window functions are supported by most modern relational database management systems (RDBMS) like PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and SQLite.
   - While there might be some syntax variations between implementations, the core concepts remain consistent across platforms.

In summary, SQL window functions provide a versatile toolkit for performing advanced analytical operations within SQL queries, offering simplicity, efficiency, and enhanced readability for complex data analysis tasks.
