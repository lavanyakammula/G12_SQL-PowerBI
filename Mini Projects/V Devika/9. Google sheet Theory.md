# 1. Introduction to Spreadsheet

- Spreadsheets were initially developed for storing, analyzing, and manipulating data, and are now commonly used for handling both text and numerical data sets.
- Each spreadsheet is comprised of a grid of cells, with each cell being identified by a unique address consisting of a column letter and row number.
- Many spreadsheet documents include multiple sheets, allowing for referencing values across different sheets within the same file.
- Spreadsheets offer capabilities for producing graphs and other data visualizations.

| Feature         | Description                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Active cell     | Anything you type will be entered in the active cell. Any formatting you apply will affect only the active cell.      |
| Row number      | Rows are numbered consecutively from 1.                                                                                 |
| Column letter   | Columns are labeled consecutively with letters. On reaching 'Z', columns are labeled AA, AB, AC, and so on.            |
| Formula bar     | This shows the content of the active cell and can be used to edit it.                                                  |
| Worksheet tabs  | Each workbook may consist of several worksheets, and the tabs are used to switch between them.                         |
|                 | Right-click or double-click the tab to rename or add color markers.                                                     |
| Zoom controls   | Spreadsheets can be very large, so the Zoom controls allow you to view a larger/smaller area of the worksheet.          |
| Ribbon          | The ribbon includes the tabs and controls for all the essential features of the Excel spreadsheet.                      |


When working with a new spreadsheet or worksheet, adjustments may be necessary, such as:

- Adding, removing, or renaming worksheets
- Changing row heights or column widths
- Inserting or removing rows and columns

### Inserting and Removing Rows and Columns

Inserting and removing rows and columns can be accomplished easily by:

- Right-clicking on the row or column header and selecting the appropriate action from the menu.
- Adjustments to row height and column width can be made by using right-click options or by dragging the edges of the rows or columns.
- It's recommended to select the desired number of rows or columns before inserting or removing them to streamline the process.

# Variables

Variables are like memory boxes that you use to store objects (e.g., workbooks or worksheets) or values (e.g., integers, text, true/false). When you set up a variable, it can easily be changed in VBA by performing some calculation with it. There are many different types of variables, but there are two main categories:

1. Object variables that can store objects like worksheets, workbooks, etc.
2. Non-Object variables that store numerical values, text, or similar values.

## Common Variable Types


| Grouping   | Variable Type | Application                                                                                                    |
|------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Numerical  | Integer       | Accepts only integer values, mainly used for counters; value needs to be between -32768 and 32767. Note: You should always use Long instead of Integer. Integer numbers used to be needed to reduce memory usage. But it is no longer necessary. |
| Numerical  | Long          | Accepts only integer values, used for larger referencing like populations; value needs to be between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,648 |
| Numerical  | Double        | Accepts decimal values with significant degree of precision; values need to be between -1.79769313486231e308 and -4.94065645841247e-324 for negative numbers and 1.79769313486231e308 and 4.94065645841247e-324 for positive numbers. |
| Text       | String        | Accepts strings of text, usually identified with double quotation marks; if a value is input without quotation marks, it will be automatically recognized as text. |
| Date/Time  | Date          | Accepts dates, needs to be between # signs, e.g., #31/12/1999#                                                 |
| Boolean    | Boolean       | Accepts True or False values.                                                                                  |
| Any        | Variant       | Accepts any type of variable.                                                                                  |
| Objects    | Workbook      | Accepts worksheet names.                                                                                       |
| Objects    | Worksheet     | Accepts worksheet names.                                                                                       |
| Objects    | Object        | Accepts all objects.                                                                                            |

# 3.Conditional Functions 
Conditional functions allow you to perform operations based on specific conditions, making your spreadsheets more dynamic and responsive. Conditional functions, such as IF statements and other logical functions, enable you to execute different actions depending on whether certain conditions are met.

| Function    | Description                                            |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **IF()**    | Performs a logical test and returns one value if the test is true and another if it's false.|
| **AND()**   | Checks if all arguments are true and returns true if they are, otherwise returns false. |
| **OR()**    | Checks if any arguments are true and returns true if at least one is true, otherwise returns false.|
| **NOT()**   | Reverses the logical value of its argument; if the argument is true, NOT returns false; if false, NOT returns true. |
| **IFS()**   | Tests multiple conditions and returns a value that corresponds to the first true condition.|
| **SWITCH()**| Compares one value against a list of values and returns a result corresponding to the first matching value.|

### IF() Function

The **IF()** function is one of the most commonly used conditional functions. It allows you to make decisions based on logical tests. Here's how it works:

- Syntax: `IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)`
- The function evaluates a logical test and returns one value if the test is true and another value if it's false.
- Example: `=IF(A1>10, "Yes", "No")`
  - If the value in cell A1 is greater than 10, the function returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

### AND() Function

The **AND()** function checks if all conditions specified are true. It returns true if all conditions are met; otherwise, it returns false.

- Syntax: `AND(condition1, condition2, ...)`
- Example: `=AND(A1>10, B1="Approved")`
  - This function returns true if the value in cell A1 is greater than 10 AND the value in cell B1 is "Approved".

### OR() Function

The **OR()** function checks if at least one condition specified is true. It returns true if any of the conditions are met; otherwise, it returns false.

- Syntax: `OR(condition1, condition2, ...)`
- Example: `=OR(A1="Red", A1="Blue")`
  - This function returns true if the value in cell A1 is either "Red" OR "Blue".

### NOT() Function

The **NOT()** function reverses the logical value of its argument. If the argument is true, NOT returns false; if false, NOT returns true.

- Syntax: `NOT(condition)`
- Example: `=NOT(A1="Done")`
  - This function returns true if the value in cell A1 is NOT "Done".

### IFS() Function

The **IFS()** function allows you to test multiple conditions and returns a value that corresponds to the first true condition.

- Syntax: `IFS(condition1, value1, condition2, value2, ...)`
- Example: `=IFS(A1>90, "A", A

# 4. Sorting , Filtering And Pivot Table

## Sorting and Filtering Data With Google Sheets

There are many built-in tools in Google Sheets to help with data management, and the sorting and filtering features are among the best. The filter tool gives you the ability to filter a column of data within a table to isolate the key components you need. The sorting tool allows you to sort by date, number, alphabetic order, and more. In the following example, we will explore the usage of sorting and filtering and show some advanced sorting techniques.

Let’s say you had the spreadsheet above and wanted to sort by price. This process is fairly simple. You can either highlight the whole column or even click on the first cell in the column to get started. Then you will:

1. Right click to open the menu
2. Go down to the Sort option – when hovering over Sort the sub-menu will appear
3. Click on Largest to Smallest
4. Select Expand the selection
5. Click OK

The whole table has now adjusted for the sorted column. Note: when the data in one column is related to the data in the remaining columns of the table, you want to select Expand the selection. This will ensure the data in that row carries over with sorted column data.

## Filtering Data

The filter feature applies a drop-down menu to each column heading, allowing you to select specific choices to narrow a table. Using the above example, let’s say you wanted to filter your table by Company and Salesperson. Specifically, you want to find the number of sales Dylan Rogers made to Eastern Company.

To do this using the filter you would:

1. Go to the Data tab on Google Sheets menu
2. Select the Filter tool
3. Select Eastern Company from the dropdown menu
4. Select Dylan Rogers from the Salesperson dropdown menu

Boom – you now have the exact number of sales Dylan Rogers made to Eastern Company.


## The Sort & Filter Tool

In addition to the right-click menu sorting option and the Filter tool on the Data menu, Google Sheets has a Sort & Filter tool that allows for custom sorting.

##  Pivot Tables

- Organize your data by aggregating the rows into interesting and useful views.
- Calculate and sum data quickly.
- Great for finding typos.

### Create a PivotTable

1. Open the file “PivotTableClass”.
2. Click on the Sales tab.
3. Select a range of data, including headers.
4. Insert tab > PivotTable button.
5. Click “OK” in the Create PivotTable dialog box.
6. Automatically directed to new sheet with PivotTable controls.
7. Drag and drop fields into Rows, Columns, and Values areas.


### Value Field and Sort

1. Using the BigData tab, create a new Pivot Table on a new page.
2. Select Region and BranchNumbers for the rows.
3. Select Sum Of Sales for the Values field twice.
4. On the drop down arrow of Sum of Sales, click on Value Field Settings.
5. Select Count.
6. Right-click on any cell in the Count of Sales column.
7. Sort from smallest to largest.

### Grouping

1. Click on a BranchNumber cell (left click).
2. Hold down the shift key.
3. Click two or three other BranchNumber cells.
4. Click on PivotTable Tools > Analyze > Group > Group Selection button.
5. Repeat this process so all the BranchNumbers are in a group.

# 5. Power of Lookup Functions 

Lookup functions in spreadsheets play a crucial role in referencing and retrieving data efficiently. They enable users to search for specific values in a dataset and retrieve corresponding results from other rows or columns. Let's delve into the power of lookup functions, focusing on VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, and LOOKUP functions:

## What Is a LOOKUP Function?

A LOOKUP function in Excel allows users to reference a cell to match values in another row or column, facilitating the retrieval of corresponding results. Key terms associated with lookup functions include:
- **Lookup:** Searching for a specified value in the data table.
- **Lookup Value:** The value to be searched for.
- **Return Value:** A value at the same position but in another row or column.

## VLOOKUP Function

The VLOOKUP function is utilized to search for data in a table organized vertically. It looks down the left column of a range to find a value and retrieve a corresponding result. Syntax:
```excel
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
```
### Steps to use VLOOKUP:

1. Select the cell for the formula calculation.
2. Choose the VLOOKUP option and configure the arguments.
3. Alternatively, use the formula bar to input the required fields.

## HLOOKUP Function

The HLOOKUP function is similar to VLOOKUP but looks up for a value in the first row of a given range and returns a value from a specified row. Syntax:

```excel
=HLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, row_index_num, [range_lookup])
```
### Steps to use HLOOKUP:

1. Click the cell for the formula calculation.
2. Select the HLOOKUP option and set the arguments.
3. Alternatively, input the formula directly into the formula bar.

## XLOOKUP Function

XLOOKUP is an advanced version of VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP, offering enhanced flexibility in data retrieval tasks. It allows searching for a return value regardless of its position in the table. Syntax:
```excel
=XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode])
```
### Steps to use XLOOKUP:

1. Configure the arguments as per the syntax.
2. Execute the function to retrieve the desired result.

## LOOKUP Function

The LOOKUP function in Excel facilitates vertical and horizontal lookups and comes in two forms: Vector and Array.

- **Vector Form:** Searches for a value in a specified column or row.
- **Array Form:** Looks for the value in the first row or column of an array.

# 7. Importing Range Data and Formatting for Excel Compatibility

This section explores importing data from another spreadsheet and formatting it for seamless use in Microsoft Excel.

## Importing Range Data

There are two primary methods to import range data into your Excel spreadsheet:

1. **Copy & Paste Link:**
    - Open both the source spreadsheet containing the data you want to import (let's call it Source.xlsx) and the destination Excel spreadsheet (Destination.xlsx).
    - In Source.xlsx, select the range of cells containing the data you want to import.
    - Right-click on the selected range and choose "Copy" or press Ctrl+C.
    - Navigate to Destination.xlsx and select the cell where you want the imported data to begin.
    - Right-click and choose "Paste Link" (not just Paste). This creates a linked connection between the two spreadsheets.
    - Any changes made to the data in Source.xlsx will automatically be reflected in Destination.xlsx when you refresh the link.

2. **Workbook Links (Excel Online & Excel 365):**
    - Similar to Copy & Paste Link, this method establishes a connection between two spreadsheets.
    - Open both Source.xlsx and Destination.xlsx. 
    - In Source.xlsx, select the range of cells you want to import.
    - Copy the selected range (Ctrl+C).
    - In Destination.xlsx, select the cell where you want the imported data to begin.
    - Right-click and choose "Paste Special."
    - Under "Paste options," select "Link." This creates a linked reference.
    - Unlike Copy & Paste Link, these links might not automatically refresh. To ensure updated data, navigate to the "Data" tab and 
      click "Edit Links" in Excel Online or "Edit Links to Files" in Excel 365. Select the link and choose "Update Now" to refresh the 
      data.


## Formatting for Excel Compatibility

When importing data from another source, especially Google Sheets, some formatting adjustments might be necessary for optimal compatibility with Excel. Here are some key points to consider:

- **Dates:** Google Sheets and Excel might handle date formats differently. Ensure the date format in your source data is compatible with Excel (e.g., dd/mm/yyyy). You might need to adjust the format after importing.
- **Numbers:** Pay attention to number formats, especially for currencies or decimals. Use the format cells option in Excel to ensure consistent formatting after import.
- **Formulas:** Simple formulas from Google Sheets might translate directly to Excel. However, complex formulas might require adjustments for syntax compatibility between the programs.
- **Charts and Graphs:** Charts and graphs imported from Google Sheets might not retain all formatting options in Excel. You might need to recreate the chart in Excel for full customization.
