    SQL THEORY

*Basic Syntax

SQL queries are structured statements used to interact with databases. Here's a basic syntax example for selecting data from a table:


SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

*Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL statements are used to define, modify, and delete database objects. Here's an example of creating a table:


CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);

*Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML statements are used to manipulate data in the database. Here's an example of inserting data into a table:


INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

*Data Query Language (DQL)

DQL statements are used to retrieve data from the database. Here's an example of a SELECT query:


SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

*Constraints

Constraints are rules applied to columns to enforce data integrity. Here's an example of adding a primary key constraint:


ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_constraint_name PRIMARY KEY (column1);

*Functions and Aggregates

Functions and aggregates are used for calculations and transformations on data. Here's an example of using the SUM aggregate function:


SELECT SUM(column1)
FROM table_name;

*Views

Views are virtual tables derived from SQL queries. Here's an example of creating a view:


CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

*Stored Procedures and Functions

Stored procedures and functions are reusable blocks of SQL code. Here's an example of creating a stored procedure:


CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
END;
*Indexes and Performance Optimization

Indexes are used to optimize query performance. Here's an example of creating an index:


CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1);

*Transactions and Concurrency Control

Transactions ensure data consistency in multi-user environments. Here's an example of starting a transaction:


BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- SQL statements
COMMIT;

*Security

SQL security mechanisms control access to database objects and data. Here's an example of granting privileges:


GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON table_name TO user_name;

*Advanced SQL Features

Advanced SQL features include subqueries, joins, and window functions for handling complex queries. Here's an example of using a subquery:


SELECT column1
FROM table1
WHERE column2 IN (SELECT column3 FROM table2);

# SQL Joins and Types

In SQL, joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns between them. Here are the commonly used types of joins:

## 1. INNER JOIN

An INNER JOIN returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.

Example:

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;

2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

A LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are used.

Example:


SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

A RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are used.

Example:

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;

4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)

A FULL JOIN returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables. It combines the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.

Example:


SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

5. CROSS JOIN

A CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., all possible combinations of rows.

Example:


SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
CROSS JOIN Orders;

These examples demonstrate how SQL joins work and their different types for combining data from multiple tables.
