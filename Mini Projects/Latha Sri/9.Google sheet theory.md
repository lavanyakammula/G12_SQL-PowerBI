   Google Sheet  Theory

## 1. Section One - Spreadsheet Basics, Variables, and Shortcuts!
### Definition:
This section covers the fundamental concepts of spreadsheets, including basic operations like data entry, formatting, and simple calculations. It also introduces variables for storing and manipulating data, along with essential keyboard shortcuts for improving productivity.

### Syntax:
- Data entry: Simply type data into cells.
- Formatting: Use formatting options in the toolbar or apply formatting commands through the Format menu.
- Calculations: Perform calculations using arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) directly in cells or through formulas.
- Variables: Store data in cells and refer to them by their cell references (e.g., A1, B2).
- Shortcuts: Utilize keyboard combinations like Ctrl+C (copy), Ctrl+V (paste), and Ctrl+S (save) for efficient spreadsheet navigation and manipulation.

### Example:
- Data entry: Type numbers or text into individual cells.
- Formatting: Select a range of cells and apply bold formatting using the toolbar.
- Calculations: Enter "=A1+B1" in cell C1 to add the values from cells A1 and B1.
- Variables: Store the value 10 in cell A1 and the value 20 in cell B1, then refer to them in formulas.
- Shortcuts: Press Ctrl+C to copy a selected range of cells, then Ctrl+V to paste the copied content elsewhere.

## 2. Section Two - Introduction to Your First Functions!
### Definition:
This section introduces basic functions available in spreadsheets, such as SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, and MIN. It covers how to use these functions to perform calculations on data and streamline workflow.

### Syntax:
- Function syntax: Functions are written as function names followed by parentheses, optionally with arguments enclosed inside.
- Arguments: Inputs provided to functions to perform specific operations.
- Range: A collection of cells specified as an argument to functions for calculations.

### Example:
- SUM function: "=SUM(A1:A10)" adds the values in cells A1 to A10.
- AVERAGE function: "=AVERAGE(B1:B5)" calculates the average of values in cells B1 to B5.
- MAX function: "=MAX(C1:C20)" returns the maximum value from cells C1 to C20.
- MIN function: "=MIN(D1:D15)" finds the minimum value in cells D1 to D15.


## 3. Section Three - Introduction to Conditional Functions
### Definition:
This section covers conditional functions like IF statements, which allow users to perform actions based on specified conditions. It explores logical functions such as AND, OR, and NOT for more complex conditional operations.

### Syntax:
- IF function syntax: "=IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)".
- Condition: A logical expression that evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE.
- Value_if_true: The result returned if the condition is TRUE.
- Value_if_false: The result returned if the condition is FALSE.
- Logical functions syntax: These functions take logical expressions as arguments and return TRUE or FALSE.

### Example:
- IF function: "=IF(A1>10, "Pass", "Fail")" returns "Pass" if the value in cell A1 is greater than 10; otherwise, it returns "Fail".
- AND function: "=AND(A1>10, B1<20)" returns TRUE if both conditions (A1>10 and B1<20) are TRUE.
- OR function: "=OR(A1="Male", A1="Female")" returns TRUE if either condition (A1 equals "Male" or A1 equals "Female") is TRUE.
- NOT function: "=NOT(A1="Complete")" returns TRUE if the value in cell A1 is not "Complete".

## 4. Section Four - Sorting, Filtering & Pivot Tables Crash Course
### Definition:
This section provides a comprehensive overview of sorting, filtering, and creating pivot tables in spreadsheets. It teaches users how to organize and analyze large datasets efficiently using these powerful features.

### Syntax:
- Sorting: Arrange data in ascending or descending order based on specified criteria.
- Filtering: Display only the data that meets certain criteria while hiding the rest.
- Pivot tables: Summarize and analyze data dynamically by arranging it into rows, columns, and values.

### Example:
- Sorting: Select a range of cells and use the sort function to reorder them alphabetically or numerically.
- Filtering: Apply a filter to a dataset and choose specific criteria to display only relevant rows.
- Pivot tables: Select the data range, choose rows, columns, and values, and then apply functions like SUM or AVERAGE to summarize data.

## 5. Section Five - Lookups
### Definition:
This section delves into lookup functions, such as VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP, which allow users to search for specific data in a table and retrieve corresponding values. It covers the concept of vertical and horizontal lookups and their practical applications.

### Syntax:
- VLOOKUP function syntax: "=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])".
- HLOOKUP function syntax: "=HLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, row_index_num, [range_lookup])".
- Lookup_value: The value to search for in the first column (VLOOKUP) or row (HLOOKUP) of the table.
- Table_array: The range of cells that contains the data.
- Col_index_num/Row_index_num: The column number (VLOOKUP) or row number (HLOOKUP) in the table from which to retrieve the value.
- Range_lookup: Optional parameter to specify whether to find an exact match (FALSE) or an approximate match (TRUE).

### Example:
- VLOOKUP function: "=VLOOKUP(A1, $B$2:$D$10, 2, FALSE)" searches for the value in cell A1 in the first column of the table range B2:D10 and returns the corresponding value from the second column.
- HLOOKUP function: "=HLOOKUP(A1, $B$2:$D$10, 3, FALSE)" searches for the value in cell A1 in the first row of the table range B2:D10 and returns the corresponding value from the third row.

## 6. Section Six - GOOGLE Functions
### Definition:
This section explores advanced functions and features unique to Google Sheets. It covers various Google functions that enhance spreadsheet capabilities, such as GOOGLEFINANCE for financial data, GOOGLETRANSLATE for language translation, and GOOGLEMAPS for geographical data.

### Syntax:
- Syntax varies depending on the specific Google function being used, but most functions follow a similar pattern of inputs and outputs.

### Example:
- GOOGLEFINANCE function: "=GOOGLEFINANCE("GOOG", "price")" retrieves the current stock price of Google (GOOG).
- GOOGLETRANSLATE function: "=GOOGLETRANSLATE("Hello", "en", "es")" translates the word "Hello" from English (en) to Spanish (es).
- GOOGLEMAPS function: "=GOOGLEMAPS("New York City")" displays a map of New York City.

## 7. Section Seven - Import Range Data create an Excel format
### Definition:
This section covers importing and manipulating data from various sources into a spreadsheet, focusing on formatting data effectively for Excel compatibility. It explores techniques for importing data from external sources and ensuring it is properly structured and formatted.

### Syntax:
- Syntax varies depending on the method used for importing data, such as using built-in import functions or external plugins.

### Example:
- Importing CSV data: "=IMPORTDATA("https://example.com/data.csv")" imports data from a CSV file hosted online.
- Importing Excel data: "=IMPORTRANGE("https://example.com/spreadsheet", "Sheet1!A1:B10")" imports data from another Google Sheets document.
- Formatting data: Use formatting tools such as text-to-columns, data validation, and conditional formatting to organize and enhance imported data.
