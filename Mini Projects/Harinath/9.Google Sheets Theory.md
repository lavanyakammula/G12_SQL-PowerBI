Syntax: =SUM(number1, [number2], ...)
Example: =SUM(B2:G2)
This formula sums the values in cells B2 to G2.
AVERAGE

Syntax: =AVERAGE(number1, [number2], ...)
Example: =AVERAGE(B2:B11)
Calculates the average of values in cells B2 to B11.
COUNT

Syntax: =COUNT(value1, [value2], ...)
Examples:
COUNT(A:A): Counts numeric values in column A.
COUNT(A1:C1): Counts values in cells A1 to C1.
COUNTA

Syntax: =COUNTA(value1, [value2], ...)
Example: COUNTA(C2:C13)
Counts all non-empty cells in the range C2 to C13.
IF

Syntax: =IF(logical_test, [value_if_true], [value_if_false])
Example: =IF(C2<D3, "TRUE", "FALSE")
Evaluates if the value in cell C2 is less than the value in cell D3.
TRIM

Syntax: =TRIM(text)
Example: TRIM(A2)
Removes extra spaces from the value in cell A2.
MAX & MIN

Syntax:
=MIN(number1, [number2], ...)
=MAX(number1, [number2], ...)
Examples:
=MIN(B2:C11): Finds the minimum value in the range B2 to C11.
=MAX(B2:C11): Finds the maximum value in the same range.


Conditional Functions
Conditional functions in Excel allow users to perform calculations based on specified conditions. These functions evaluate whether a given condition is true or false before executing the calculation. Here's an overview of the conditional functions covered in this course:

1. IF Function
Syntax: =IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)
Example: =IF(A2 > 3, 32, "Number too small")
If condition (A2 > 3) is true, set the cell to 32; otherwise, set it to "Number too small".
2. Nested IF Function
Syntax: =IF(condition1, value_if_true1, IF(condition2, value_if_true2, value_if_false2))
Example: =IF(A2 > 3, "Number too large", IF(A2 < 1, "Number too small", "Just right!"))
Tests whether A2 is larger than 3, less than 1, or between 1 and 3, and sets the cell accordingly.
3. COUNTIF Function
Syntax: =COUNTIF(range, criteria)
Example: =COUNTIF(F1:F230, "=red")
Counts the number of cells in the range F1:F230 that satisfy the condition "=red".
4. SUMIF Function
Syntax: =SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])
Example: =SUMIF(D1:D230, "=television", H1:H230)
Sums the values in cells H1:H230 where the corresponding cell in D1:D230 satisfies the condition "=television".
5. AND Function
Syntax: =AND(condition1, condition2)
Example: =AND(A2 > 3, B2 < 10)
Returns TRUE if both conditions (A2 > 3 and B2 < 10) are true; otherwise, returns FALSE.
6. OR Function
Syntax: =OR(condition1, condition2)
Example: =OR(A2 > 3, B2 < 10)
Returns TRUE if at least one of the conditions (A2 > 3 or B2 < 10) is true; otherwise, returns FALSE.

Lookups: Unleashing the Power of Lookup Functions
In this guide, you'll discover the power of lookup functions in spreadsheets. Learn how to use VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and other lookup functions to retrieve data from different sources with ease.

1. VLOOKUP Function
The VLOOKUP function allows you to search for a value in the first column of a range (table array) and return a value in the same row from a column you specify. It's particularly useful for looking up data in large datasets or tables.

Syntax:

=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
Parameters:
lookup_value: The value you want to search for.
table_array: The range of cells that contains the data.
col_index_num: The column number in the table from which to return the value.
range_lookup: [Optional] TRUE for an approximate match or FALSE for an exact match.
2. HLOOKUP Function
Similar to VLOOKUP, the HLOOKUP function searches for a value in the top row of a range (table array) and returns a value in the same column from a row you specify.

Syntax:

=HLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, row_index_num, [range_lookup])
Parameters:
lookup_value: The value you want to search for.
table_array: The range of cells that contains the data.
row_index_num: The row number in the table from which to return the value.
range_lookup: [Optional] TRUE for an approximate match or FALSE for an exact match.
3. LOOKUP Function
The LOOKUP function searches for a value either in a one-row or one-column range (vector) or in an array.

Syntax:

=LOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_vector, [result_vector])
Parameters:
lookup_value: The value you want to search for.
lookup_vector: The range of cells that contains the data to be searched.
result_vector: [Optional] The range of cells that contains the corresponding values to be returned.
4. INDEX and MATCH Functions
While not traditional lookup functions, INDEX and MATCH functions are often used together to achieve the same results as VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP, offering more flexibility.

INDEX Syntax:

=INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num])
MATCH Syntax:

=MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])
