Structured Query Language (SQL): Selecting, Filtering, and Sorting Data
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful tool for interacting with relational database management systems (RDBMS). It allows users to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data efficiently. In this guide, we will explore the SELECT statement, the WHERE clause, sorting, and filtering, providing practical SQL examples to illustrate their usage.

The SELECT Statement
The SELECT statement is fundamental to SQL querying as it retrieves data from one or more database tables. Here's the basic syntax:


SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
SELECT: Specifies retrieving data from the database.
column1, column2, ...: Names of the columns to retrieve data from. Use * to select all columns.
FROM table_name: Indicates the table from which to fetch the data.
Example 1: Retrieving All Columns from a Table

SELECT *
FROM employees;
The WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause adds the capability to filter data based on certain conditions. It specifies conditions that must be satisfied for a row to be included in the result set. Syntax:


SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
WHERE: Indicates applying a filter to the data.
condition: Expression determining whether a row should be included in the result set or not.
Example 2: Filtering Data

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 5;
Sorting Data
Sorting arranges the result set in a specified order using the ORDER BY clause. Syntax:


SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
ORDER BY: Indicates sorting the data.
column1, column2, ...: Columns by which the result set will be sorted.
ASC|DESC: Specifies the sort order (ASC for ascending, DESC for descending).
Example 3: Sorting Data in Ascending Order

SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY last_name ASC;
Filtering Data with LIKE and % Wildcard
The LIKE operator, along with the % wildcard, allows for pattern matching on text-based columns. It's useful for filtering data based on partial matches. Syntax:


SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
LIKE: Operator for pattern matching.
pattern: Pattern to match, with % as a wildcard.
Example 4: Filtering Data with LIKE

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE 'S%';

Data Definition Language (DDL)
Data Definition Language (DDL) is essential for creating and modifying the structure of objects in a database. These objects include tables, sequences, locations, aliases, schemas, and indexes. DDL provides predefined commands with specific syntax to perform these tasks efficiently. Here are the five primary DDL commands in SQL:

CREATE Command
DROP Command
ALTER Command
TRUNCATE Command
RENAME Command
CREATE Command
The CREATE command is used to create databases, tables, triggers, and other database objects. Below is an example of creating a new database:


CREATE DATABASE Database_Name;
Example:


CREATE DATABASE Books;
DROP Command
The DROP command is used to delete or remove database objects from the SQL database. You can remove entire tables, views, or indexes using this command:


DROP DATABASE Database_Name;
Example:


DROP DATABASE Books;
ALTER Command
The ALTER command modifies the existing structure of the database and can change the schema of database objects. It can also add or drop constraints of the table. Here's an example of adding a new field to an existing table:


ALTER TABLE name_of_table ADD column_name column_definition;
Example:


ALTER TABLE Student ADD Father's_Name VARCHAR(60);
TRUNCATE Command
The TRUNCATE command deletes or removes all records from a table and releases the space allocated for storing the table records. Here's the syntax:


TRUNCATE TABLE Table_Name;
Example:


TRUNCATE TABLE Student;
RENAME Command
The RENAME command changes the name of a database table. Here's the syntax:


RENAME TABLE Old_Table_Name TO New_Table_Name;

Example:

RENAME TABLE Student TO Student_Details;

Data Manipulation Language
The SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) is crucial for querying and modifying database data. In this chapter, we'll delve into the usage of the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE SQL DML command statements.

SELECT Statement
The SELECT statement allows users to extract data from tables based on specific criteria. It follows this sequence:

SELECT DISTINCT item(s)
FROM table(s)
WHERE predicate
GROUP BY field(s)
ORDER BY fields;
Example: Generating an employee phone list from the Employees table:

SELECT FirstName, LastName, phone
FROM Employees
ORDER BY LastName;
INSERT Statement
The INSERT statement adds rows to a table. Here's the syntax:


INSERT [INTO] Table_name | view_name [column_list]
DEFAULT VALUES | values_list | select_statement;
Example: Adding a record to the publisherâ€™s Authors table:


INSERT INTO Authors
VALUES('555-093-467', 'Martin', 'April', '281 555-5673', '816 Market St.', 'Vancouver', 'BC', 'V7G3P4', 0);
UPDATE Statement
The UPDATE statement modifies existing rows by adding new data or modifying existing data.

Example: Standardizing the country field to be Canada for all records in the Publishers table:


UPDATE Publishers
SET country = 'Canada';
Example: Increasing the royalty amount by 10% for those royalty amounts between 10 and 20:


UPDATE roysched
SET royalty = royalty + (royalty * .10)
WHERE royalty BETWEEN 10 and 20;
DELETE Statement
The DELETE statement removes rows from a record set. Here's the syntax:


DELETE [FROM] {table_name | view_name }
[WHERE clause];
Example: Deleting all rows from a table:

DELETE
FROM Discounts;
Example: Deleting selected rows:

DELETE
FROM Sales
WHERE stor_id = '6380';

Data Query Language (DQL) 
Data Query Language (DQL) is a subset of SQL commands primarily used for querying and retrieving data from existing database tables. The main focus of DQL is the SELECT statement, which fetches data according to specified criteria. Below, we'll explore the SELECT statement and its common clauses:

SELECT Statement
The SELECT statement is the primary command used in DQL to retrieve data from one or more tables.

Basic Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
To select all columns from a table, you can use SELECT * FROM table_name.

WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used with the SELECT statement to filter records based on specific conditions.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Example:

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
JOIN Clauses
JOIN clauses are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Types of joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.

Syntax:

SELECT columns
FROM table1 [JOIN TYPE] JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
GROUP BY Clause
The GROUP BY clause is used with aggregate functions (like COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result set by one or more columns.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
ORDER BY Clause
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC];

Constraints in SQL
Constraints are rules that restrict the values that can be inserted, deleted, or updated in a table. They ensure data integrity and enforce certain conditions on the data stored in a database. Here, we'll discuss primary key, referential integrity (foreign key), check, and unique constraints in SQL.

Primary Key Constraint
A primary key constraint is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures that there are no duplicate values and allows for efficient querying and indexing.

Syntax:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
Referential Integrity Constraint (Foreign Key)
A foreign key constraint maintains referential integrity between two related tables. It ensures that the values in a column (or combination of columns) in one table match the values in the primary key column(s) of another table.

Syntax:

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
Check Constraint
A check constraint sets restrictions on the values that can be inserted into a column. It allows you to define custom rules to ensure data integrity.

Syntax:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CHECK (Age >= 18)
);
Unique Constraint
A unique constraint ensures that all values in a column (or combination of columns) are unique. It prevents duplicate entries and provides uniqueness within a table.

Syntax:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    UNIQUE (ID)
);

SQL aggregate functions are used to perform calculations on groups of rows in a table, allowing for meaningful insights into the dataset. They can be applied to calculate totals, averages, maximum, minimum values, and more. Below are some common scenarios where SQL aggregate functions are useful:

Calculating the total or average value of a specific column across all rows in a table.
Grouping rows based on specific criteria and then calculating summary values for each group.
Filtering rows based on summary values.
Combining multiple tables and calculating summary values across the combined dataset.
Here are the standard SQL aggregate functions:

COUNT: Returns the total number of rows in a table or the number of non-NULL values in a column.
SUM: Returns the sum of all non-NULL values in a column.
AVG: Returns the average of all non-NULL values in a column.
MIN: Returns the minimum non-NULL value in a column.
MAX: Returns the maximum non-NULL value in a column.
Let's see some examples of using these functions:

Example: Using MIN Function

-- Find the lowest price in the Price column:
SELECT MIN(Price)
FROM Products;
Example: Using MAX Function

-- Find the highest price in the Price column:
SELECT MAX(Price)
FROM Products;
Example: Using COUNT Function

-- Find the total number of rows in the Products table:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Products;
Example: Using SUM Function

-- Return the sum of all Quantity fields in the OrderDetails table:
SELECT SUM(Quantity)
FROM OrderDetails;
Example: Using AVG Function

-- Find the average price of all products:
SELECT AVG(Price)
FROM Products;


SQL Views
Views in SQL are virtual tables that don't store data on disk like physical tables. Instead, they represent the result of a customized query that retrieves data from one or more tables. Views provide a convenient way to present data from multiple tables as if it were coming from a single source.

Creating Views in SQL
Views can be created using the CREATE VIEW statement. You can create a view from a single table or multiple tables.

Syntax:

sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2.....
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Parameters:

view_name: Name for the view.
table_name: Name of the table(s) from which to select data.
condition: Optional condition to select rows.
Example: Creating a View

CREATE VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT order_date, customer_name, product_name, quantity, unit_price, quantity * unit_price AS total_price
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id;
This creates a view named sales_summary that contains information about sales transactions, including the order date, customer name, product name, quantity, unit price, and total price.

Updating Views in SQL
Views can be updated using the ALTER VIEW statement to modify the view's definition.

Syntax:

ALTER VIEW view_name AS
SELECT new_column1, new_column2.....
FROM new_table_name
WHERE new_condition;
Deleting Views in SQL
Views can be deleted using the DROP VIEW statement.

Syntax:

DROP VIEW view_name;
Example: Deleting a View

DROP VIEW sales_summary;
Deleting a view removes its definition from the database, but it doesn't affect the underlying tables or data.

SQL Stored Procedures
A stored procedure in SQL is a precompiled set of SQL statements that can be stored in the database for later use. It allows you to encapsulate complex logic and frequently used queries, making them reusable and easier to manage.

Stored Procedure Syntax
Stored procedures are created using the CREATE PROCEDURE statement followed by the procedure name and the SQL statements to be executed within the procedure.

Syntax:

CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
sql_statement;

Example:

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeData
AS
SELECT * FROM Employees;
Execute a Stored Procedure
Stored procedures can be executed using the EXEC or EXECUTE statement followed by the name of the stored procedure.

Syntax:

EXEC procedure_name;
Example:

EXEC GetEmployeeData;
Passing Parameters to Stored Procedures
Stored procedures can also accept parameters, allowing them to act based on the values passed to them.

Syntax for Creating Procedure with Parameters:

CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
    @parameter1 data_type,
    @parameter2 data_type
AS
sql_statement;
Example:

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByDepartment
    @dept_id INT
AS
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE department_id = @dept_id;
Syntax for Executing Procedure with Parameters:

EXEC procedure_name value1, value2;
Example:

EXEC GetEmployeeByDepartment 5;


Indexing
Indexing in databases enhances query performance by creating pointers to the location of data within a database. This makes it faster to retrieve information, particularly when searching through large datasets.

Types of Indexes
There are two primary types of indexes in databases:

Clustered Index: This type of index determines the physical order of data rows in a table. In a clustered index, the rows are stored in the order of the index key.

Non-Clustered Index: Non-clustered indexes store the index key values separately from the actual data rows. Each index entry contains a pointer to the corresponding data row.

Both clustered and non-clustered indexes are stored and searched using B-trees, a self-balancing tree data structure. B-trees allow for efficient searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.

Creating an Index
To create an index in SQL, you use the CREATE INDEX statement followed by the index name and the column(s) to be indexed.

Syntax:

CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1 [, column2, ...]);
Example:

CREATE INDEX friends_name_asc ON friends(name ASC);
This example creates an index named friends_name_asc on the name column of the friends table, sorting the names alphabetically in ascending order.

Transactions in SQL
In SQL, transactions allow you to group multiple SQL statements into a single logical unit of work that either succeeds entirely or fails entirely. Transactions help maintain data consistency and integrity by ensuring that changes to the database occur in a controlled and predictable manner.

Basic Syntax
In SQL, transactions are managed using the following statements:

START TRANSACTION: Begins a new transaction.
COMMIT: Saves changes made during the transaction and ends the transaction.
ROLLBACK: Reverts any changes made during the transaction and ends the transaction.
Example:

START TRANSACTION;
    -- SQL statements to perform within the transaction
COMMIT;
Example with Error Handling
You can use error handling to manage exceptions that occur during a transaction using the DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION block.

Example:

START TRANSACTION;
    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
        ROLLBACK;
    -- SQL statements to perform within the transaction
COMMIT;
Using Savepoints
Savepoints allow you to create intermediate points within a transaction to which you can roll back if needed.

Example:

START TRANSACTION;
    -- SQL statements to perform within the transaction
    SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    -- More SQL statements
    ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
    -- Additional SQL statements
COMMIT;
Concurrency Control in DBMS
Concurrency control protocols are used in databases to manage concurrent access to data while maintaining data consistency.

Lock-Based Protocols
Lock-based protocols use locks to control access to data. Two common types of locks are:

Shared Lock: Allows simultaneous reading of data by multiple transactions.
Exclusive Lock: Allows a transaction to modify data exclusively.
Timestamp-Based Protocols
Timestamp-based protocols use timestamps to order transactions and ensure data consistency.

Isolation Levels
Isolation levels define the degree to which transactions are isolated from each other and affect how transactions interact with one another.

Read Uncommitted: Lowest isolation level, allowing dirty reads.
Read Committed: Default isolation level, preventing dirty reads but allowing non-repeatable reads.
Repeatable Read: Ensures repeatable reads but may allow phantom reads.
Serializable: Highest isolation level, preventing all concurrency anomalies.

Advanced SQL Features
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for interacting with databases, and it offers a wide range of advanced features to enhance data management, manipulation, and analysis. In this guide, we'll explore some of the advanced features of SQL.

1. Window Functions
Window functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. They operate on a "window" of rows defined by a partition or specific ordering. Common window functions include ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), LEAD(), and LAG().

Example:


SELECT 
    employee_id,
    last_name,
    salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_within_department
FROM 
    employees;
2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Common Table Expressions (CTEs) allow you to define temporary result sets that can be referenced within a query. They improve readability and maintainability by breaking complex queries into smaller, more manageable parts.

Example:

WITH high_salary_employees AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        last_name,
        salary
    FROM 
        employees
    WHERE 
        salary > 100000
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    high_salary_employees
ORDER BY 
    salary DESC;
3. Recursive Queries
Recursive queries enable you to query hierarchical data, such as organizational charts or bill-of-material structures. They use a common table expression (CTE) with a recursive anchor and recursive member.

Example:

WITH recursive employee_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        manager_id,
        last_name
    FROM 
        employees
    WHERE 
        manager_id IS NULL -- Root level employees
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        e.employee_id,
        e.manager_id,
        e.last_name
    FROM 
        employees e
    JOIN 
        employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    employee_hierarchy;
4. JSON Support
Many modern database systems provide built-in support for storing, querying, and manipulating JSON data. This allows for more flexible and dynamic data modeling, especially in applications with varying schema requirements.

Example:

SELECT 
    order_id,
    customer,
    order_date,
    JSON_VALUE(order_details, '$.total_amount') AS total_amount
FROM 
    orders;
5. Pivoting and Unpivoting
Pivoting involves rotating data from rows into columns, while unpivoting involves rotating data from columns into rows. These operations are useful for transforming data to better suit reporting and analysis requirements.

Example (Pivoting):

SELECT 
    product,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'January' THEN revenue END) AS January,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'February' THEN revenue END) AS February,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'March' THEN revenue END) AS March
FROM 
    sales
GROUP BY 
    product;
Example (Unpivoting):

SELECT 
    product,
    month,
    revenue
FROM 
    sales
UNPIVOT (
    revenue FOR month IN (January, February, March)
) AS unpivoted_sales;
