# Healthcare Dataset Queries and Explanations

## 1) What is the most common admission type?
### Theory:
  The following query selects the admission type column and counts occurrences for each type. It then orders the results in descending order and limits to 1 to identify the most common admission type.
### Query:
```sql
SELECT admission_type, COUNT(admission_type) 
FROM healthcare_datasets 
GROUP BY admission_type 
ORDER BY COUNT(admission_type) DESC LIMIT 1;
```

## 2) How many male and female patients are there?
### Theory:
  By selecting the gender column and using the COUNT() function, the query groups patients by gender, providing a count for each category.
### Query:
```sql
SELECT gender, COUNT(gender) 
FROM healthcare_datasets 
GROUP BY gender;
```

## 3) What is the most common blood type among patients?
### Theory:
This query selects the blood type column, counts occurrences for each blood type, orders the results in descending order, and limits to the top 5 to determine the most common blood types among patients.
### Query:
```sql
SELECT blood_type, COUNT(blood_type) 
FROM healthcare_datasets 
GROUP BY blood_type 
ORDER BY COUNT(blood_type) DESC LIMIT 5;
```

## 4) Which doctor has admitted the most patients?
### Theory:
The Following query groups the dataset by doctors, counts the number of admissions for each doctor, orders the results in descending order, and limits to the top result to find the doctor who admitted the most patients.
### Query:
```sql
SELECT doctor, COUNT(*) 
FROM healthcare_datasets 
GROUP BY doctor 
ORDER BY COUNT(doctor) DESC LIMIT 1;
```

## 5) What is the most common medical condition?
### Theory:
By selecting the medical condition column, counting occurrences for each condition, and sorting in descending order, the query identifies the most common medical conditions among patients.
### Query:
```sql
SELECT medical_condition, COUNT(*) 
FROM healthcare_datasets 
GROUP BY medical_condition 
ORDER BY COUNT(medical_condition) DESC;
```

## 6) What is the most frequently prescribed medication?
### Theory:
This query selects the medical condition and medication columns, counts occurrences for each medication within a medical condition, and sorts in descending order to find the most frequently prescribed medications.
### Query:
```sql
SELECT medical_condition, medication, COUNT(medication) 
FROM healthcare_datasets 
GROUP BY medical_condition, medication 
ORDER BY COUNT(medication) DESC;
```

## 7) Which year has the highest patient visits?
### Theory:
This Query works by extracting the year from the date of the admission column, counting admissions for each year, and sorting in descending order, the query determines the year with the highest patient visits.
### Query:
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_of_admission), COUNT(*) 
FROM healthcare_datasets 
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date_of_admission) 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;
```

## 8) How many patients had Normal / Abnormal Test results?
### Theory:
The query selects the test results column, counts occurrences for each result type (normal/abnormal/Inclusive), and orders the results in descending order to provide the count for each category.
### Query:
```sql
SELECT test_results, COUNT(*) 
FROM healthcare_datasets 
GROUP BY test_results 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

## 9) What are the most common medical conditions among patients with different age groups?
### Theory:
Categorizing patients into age groups, the query selects the age group and medical condition columns, counts occurrences for each condition within an age group, and sorts the results accordingly.
### Query:
```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN age BETWEEN 15 AND 25 THEN '15-25'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 26 AND 35 THEN '26-35'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN '36-50'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 51 AND 90 THEN '51-90'
    END AS age_group,
    medical_condition,
    COUNT(*) AS condition_count
FROM healthcare_datasets
GROUP BY age_group, medical_condition
ORDER BY age_group, condition_count DESC;
```

## 10) Which insurance provider had the highest number of patients?
### Theory:
By selecting the insurance provider column, counting occurrences for each provider, and sorting in descending order, the query identifies the insurance provider with the highest number of patients.
### Query:
```sql
SELECT insurance_provider, COUNT(*), SUM(billing_amount) 
FROM healthcare_datasets 
GROUP BY insurance_provider 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;
```

## 11) What age group of people are visiting the hospital most?
### Theory:
Categorizing patients into age groups, the query selects the age group column, counts occurrences for each group, and sorts the results accordingly to find the age group that visits the hospital most.
### Query:
```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN age BETWEEN 15 AND 25 THEN '15-25'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 26 AND 35 THEN '26-35'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN '36-50'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 51 AND 90 THEN '51-90'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS age_group,
    COUNT(*) 
FROM healthcare_datasets 
GROUP BY age_group 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;
```
```
